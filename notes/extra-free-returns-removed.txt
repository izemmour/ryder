Key Finding: Extra "Free Returns" Text Removed

From the screenshot, I can confirm:
1. The shipping message now shows: "Ships to Brazil · 5-8 days" (no extra "Free Returns" in blue)
2. The trust badges correctly show: "100-Night Guarantee", "Free Returns", "Award-Winning Quality"

The extra "Free Returns" text that was appearing in blue has been removed from:
- ShippingMessage inline variant (line 71)
- ShippingMessage badge variant (line 88)
- ShippingMessage checkout variant (line 121)
- Home.tsx Choose Your Setup section (removed the extra ShippingMessage badge component)

Now the non-US visitors see:
- Shipping message: "Ships to [Country] · [delivery time]" (no extra badge text)
- Trust badges: "Free Returns" and "Award-Winning Quality" (replacing "Free Shipping" and "Made in USA")
