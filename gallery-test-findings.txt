Gallery Test Findings - Mother's Day Page
==========================================

Date: 2026-01-22

Issue Found:
- Mother's Day page is showing a gift box image with pink ribbon and flowers
- This is NOT the standard hero-pillow.png image
- The config has been updated to use standard images but the page is still showing old images

Root Cause:
- The UseCasePage component is still using the old gallery rendering code
- It reads from config.gallery.images array directly
- The config was updated but the page component still renders the old way

Thumbnails visible (from screenshot):
- Thumbnail 12: "5-star" (hero pillow)
- Thumbnail 13: (lifestyle image - no tag visible)
- Thumbnail 14: (engineering detail - no tag visible)
- Thumbnail 15: "VS" (comparison)
- Thumbnail 16: "care" (washing machine)
- Thumbnail 17: "FLUFFCo vs hotels" (hotel comparison)
- Thumbnail 18: "hotel" (packaging)

Solution Needed:
- Update UseCasePage to use the new ProductGallery component
- OR update UseCasePage to read from config.gallery.images correctly

Current config.gallery.images (from mothers-day.config.ts):
1. /images/hero-pillow.png (standard)
2. /images/lifestyle-sleep.png (standard)
3. /images/engineering-detail-new.png (standard)
4. comparison (component)
5. /images/washing-machine.png (standard)
6. /images/hotel-comfort-packaging.png (standard)
7. hotel-comparison (component)

The main image showing is valentine-unboxing.png which is NOT in the config.
This suggests the UseCasePage has hardcoded images or is reading from a different source.
