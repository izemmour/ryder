# Image Generation Notes

## Current neck-pain-cervical-alignment.png
- Shows a contoured memory foam neck pillow (NOT the FluffCo design)
- Person lying on back with spine/cervical alignment visualization (blue glowing line)
- Clean, medical/clinical style with light blue/white background
- Mannequin-like figure in blue clothing

## FluffCo Pillow Design (from hero-pillow.png)
- Standard rectangular down-alternative pillow
- Soft, plush, fluffy appearance
- White cotton shell with subtle texture
- NOT a contoured or neck-specific pillow shape
- Luxurious hotel-quality look

## Required: New neck-pain gallery image 2
- Keep: Person lying down with cervical spine alignment visualization (blue glow line)
- Keep: Clean, professional medical/wellness style
- Change: Replace contoured neck pillow with FluffCo standard rectangular down pillow
- The pillow should look soft and plush like the hero image, not rigid/contoured
