# Gallery Issue Analysis - UseCasePage

## Current State (Side Sleeper Page)
The gallery IS working and showing:
- 7 thumbnail buttons visible (4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
- Thumbnails show: 5-star, tips, 3 layers, VS (comparison), care, hotel, FLUFFCo vs hotels
- Main image area appears to be loading but not showing the pillow image

## Issue Identified
The main gallery image is NOT displaying (grey/empty area visible)
The thumbnails are present but the main image container appears empty

## Root Cause Investigation Needed
1. Check if images are loading properly
2. Check if imageLoaded state is working correctly
3. Verify image paths are correct

## User's Complaint
- Missing pillow images in hero section
- Missing images 1, 4, and 7 in gallery
- Missing pills/badges on images 2 and 3
- Missing thumbnail add-ons

## Solution Approach
The user wants the UseCasePage to use the EXACT same hero section component as Home.tsx
Instead of recreating the gallery, extract it as a reusable component
