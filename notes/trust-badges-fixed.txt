Key Finding: Trust Badges Now Working for Non-US Visitors

From the screenshot, I can see the trust badges now correctly show:
- "100-Night Guarantee" (unchanged)
- "Free Returns" (instead of "Free Shipping" for non-US)
- "Award-Winning Quality" (instead of "Made in USA" for non-US)

The shipping message also shows:
- "Ships to Brazil · Free Returns · 5-8 days"

This confirms the useSiteSettings hook is now correctly overriding:
- shipping_text with nonUsBadgeText for non-US visitors
- origin_text with nonUsAlternativeUspTitle for non-US visitors

The fix was made by updating useSiteSettings.ts to:
1. Import useGeolocation and isUSVisitor
2. Check if visitor is from US
3. Override shipping_text and origin_text for non-US visitors
